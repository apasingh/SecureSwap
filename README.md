# SecureSwap

Team Members: Aparna Singh, Ryan Chen, Maisha Miah

Many people turn to Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, or eBay to sell their used goods. However, there is always a fear of being scammed, either as a buyer or a seller. There are many stories of people who did not receive the product they wanted, or did not receive the money they were owed for the product. It is easy to say that the second-hand exchange market is not very reliable. 

We propose SecureSwap, a secure way of buying and selling goods. SecureSwap would run on a decentralized platform, backed by the Ethereum blockchain. This is a service for both buyers and sellers, ensuring efficient transactions and market agent privacy. With the Ethereum blockchain, we can facilitate issuing payments to sellers and withdrawing money from a buyerâ€™s account. The platform would allow all steps in the buying and selling process to be executed fairly, ensuring that both parties are satisfied with the transaction.
